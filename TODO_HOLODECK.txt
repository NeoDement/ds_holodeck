pencil cursor tool
eraser tool
bigger paint brush - you can do it by grabbing the pixel x y of the pixels around the pixel

also instead of a pencil cursor maybe just highlight the pixels that will be recoloured

colour dropper tool

right click eraser tool






SNAP cmd width/height will be changed too. to match sprite bounds.


claer isnt clearing top left pixel.








these probably aren't needed, cato only takes one number.

We will have enough OVs because timer and collision won't need chemicals.


(11 vars per action)
(9 valid actions)

99 variables in use.

HOWEVER.

timer and collision won't need chemicals.
so that's 5 variables (1 string and 4 floats) x2
-10

89 variables in use.


this leaves us 10 variables which is almost enough for a script which moves OVs into temporary OVs.
